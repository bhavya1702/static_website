                        The Adalaj stepwell is intricately carved and is five stories deep. It was built in 1498.
                        An inscription in Sanskrit establishes the history of the Adalaj stepwell found on a marble &emsp;slab positioned in a
                        recess on the first floor,
                        from the eastern entry to the well. Its construction was started by Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela dynasty of
                        Dandai Desh,
                        who built it in traditional architectural style, in 1499.
